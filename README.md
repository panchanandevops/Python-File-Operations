Welcome to Python-File-Operations! This repository is your go-to resource for efficient file operations in Python, covering reading, writing, and manipulating files for enhanced data handling.

## Server Configuration File

Explore a sample server configuration file (`server.conf`) with various settings:

```python
# Server Configuration File

# Network Settings
PORT = 8080
MAX_CONNECTIONS = 600
TIMEOUT = 30

# Security Settings
SSL_ENABLED = True
SSL_CERT = '/path/to/certificate.pem'

# Logging Settings
LOG_LEVEL = 'INFO'
LOG_FILE = '/var/log/server.log'

# Other Settings
ENABLE_FEATURE_X = True
```

This configuration file serves as a template for your server settings.

## Update Server Configuration Script

Included in this repository is a handy script (`update_server.py`) that allows you to dynamically update the server configuration. Here's how to use it:

1. **Specify the Configuration File Path:**
   ```python
   # Path to the server configuration file
   server_config_file = 'server.conf'
   ```

2. **Choose the Key and New Value:**
   ```python
   # Key and new value for updating the server configuration
   key_to_update = 'MAX_CONNECTIONS'
   new_value = '600'  # New maximum connections allowed
   ```

3. **Run the Script:**
   ```python
   # Update the server configuration file
   update_server_config(server_config_file, key_to_update, new_value)
   ```

Feel free to explore and adapt these Python file operations to streamline your configuration management. Happy coding!
